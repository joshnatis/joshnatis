Escaping from the [myth of determinism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdnGPQaICjk) in technology.

Interests and questions:
```
* Fundamentally new ideas about computing
  (not hyper-optimizing Linux on the x86 architecture)
* Are computers and nature adversaries? Do they have to be?
  How can we create a symbiotic relationship between them?
* Trying to reconcile being a Luddite with being a computer scientist
* 1960s counterculture movements and ideals
* Conciousness and intelligence (human and otherwise)
* Alternative social and economic systems
  (capitalist realism[1]: is there no alternative?)
* Computing History
* Operating Systems
* Programming Languages
* Embedded Systems
* Computer Music
* Synthesizers
* Sound
* Media (physical and virtual, samizdat)
* Document markup languages and typesetting systems
* Transcending simulations and metaphors in computing
  (the computer can be more than simulated machines, appliances, paper, offices)
* Human-computer Interaction (aÌ€ la Ted Nelson and Alan Kay)
* Making computing interdisciplinary
* Learning
* Teaching
* Freedom
* Simplicity
* UNIX
* Plants swaying in the wind, fluid dynamics, flocks of birds
* Outer space
* Soviet Union media and cinema
* Ambient music
